Script to scrap linkedin jobs

<h2>Job Scrapper for LinkedIn</h2>
<p>
  I have created an interface that is used to scrap linkedin jobs.
  The interface will give you a word cloud that shows which skills are required for searched job.
</p>
<p>
  The target jobs are development jobs in general.
  The skills that are going to be search through the job posts are given in a hard-coded dictionary.
</p>
<p>
  Inside the source code, we are accesing the job information at some point and i am extracting the required skills information from the job posts.
  If you need to extract some other information from the job description, you can edit the code and achieve want you want.
</p>
<p>
  You can reach out to me for feedbacks and suggestions.
